## Overview
---
**TemStaPro** predicts the thermal stability of proteins across different temperature conditions using only amino acid sequences as input. It estimates both global and local stability profiles without requiring structural information.

## Mechanism
---
Protein sequences are processed through **ProtT5**, a protein language model that generates high-dimensional embeddings for each residue. This converts the sequence into a feature matrix representing its physicochemical context. The training dataset is labeled by temperature ranges, framing the task as a **binary classification** (stable vs. unstable) for each range. TemStaPro employs a **temperature-specific binary classifier** to predict stability at multiple thermal intervals.

## Input, Output, Options
---

**Input**:
- Amino acid sequence (FASTA format)

**Output**:
- Overall protein stability score
- Residue-level local stability scores
- Segment- and temperature-specific stability results

**Configuration Parameters**:
- **Temperature range**: Specify which thermal intervals to evaluate
- **Segment length**: Define subsequence size for local analysis

## Applications & Key Features
---
- Screening protein variants for stability during engineering or optimization
- Evaluating candidate molecules in early drug discovery
- Proven effective in studies on **CRISPR-Cas Class II effector proteins (C2EPs)**
- Trained on large-scale **OGT-based datasets**, providing broad coverage and high prediction accuracy

## Comparable Models
---
TemStaPro currently has **no direct successor model** and outperforms traditional regression-based algorithms in both accuracy and speed.

## Related Models
---
TemStaPro can be combined with:
- **NetSolP** to jointly evaluate **protein solubility and stability**.
- Useful for assessing the baseline stability of **de novo sequences** generated by **MPNN-based models**.
